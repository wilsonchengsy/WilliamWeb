### analytical thinking

[Analytical Skills: Definitions and Examples](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/analytical-skills)

Analyzing a subject means that you’ve cultivated an in-depth understanding of it and are able to speak to it with some level of expertise.

Most analytical thinking requires trial and error. Those with strong analytical thinking skills are often capable of quickly analyzing a situation, topic or problem, and often work well in a team setting to accomplish goals.

1. Identifying a topic, problem or issue
2. Gathering information through testing and observation
3. Developing solutions or deepening your understanding of the topic
4. Testing solutions or new ideas based on what you’ve learned
5. Post-analysis, or reviewing what solutions worked, to assess and apply your new knowledge

A key element to analytical thinking is the ability to quickly identify cause and effect relationships. This means understanding what might happen during the problem-solving process, for example, and examining how new ideas relate to the original topic.

Using analytical skills in your everyday work shows you’re a reliable and pragmatic thinker, able to base your decisions on meaningful data. For example, you have a limited amount of time to spend on work each day. Deciding how to spend your time in a way that will make an impact for your business can quickly make you a valued and indispensable team member. You can use your analytical skills to determine which tasks will help you make the most progress towards your goals.
