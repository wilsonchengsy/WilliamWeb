I believe that healthy financial decisions are crucial to a brighter future. Accordingly, my goal of pursuing a master’s degree in finance at Gies College of Business is to ultimately help individuals and corporations make better financial decisions, thus enabling them to achieve their life goals.

During my undergraduate studies, I had an opportunity to travel to Nepal as a leader of an international medical volunteer group. To alleviate local poverty issues, my partner and I created a connection between the local community committees and a non-profit organization in Taiwan to ensure their income from selling handicrafts to Taiwan. Living among the Nepalis, experiencing their daily lives, and witnessing their extreme poverty, I learned that financial accessibility is a vital stepping stone to education and health. The experience inspires me to learn and become a more well-rounded financial advisor.

To further my long-term plan, I intend to take advantage of Gies’s Asset Management Specialization, learning to comprehend the larger picture of wealth management and to tackle potential risks. Furthermore, I hope to utilize the Finance Practicum to polish my problem-solving skills and put theories into practice. The school’s wide variety of resources will allow me to explore different possibilities in my financial career and lay the foundation for me to add value to an equally wide variety of societal aspects.

I value the qualities of altruism, generosity, and kindness.
