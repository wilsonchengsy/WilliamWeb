Simon Finance &
 Investment Club
Simon School Venture Fund

Simon Volunteers: Our mission is to positively represents Simon Business School in the greater Rochester community and to enhance the lives of community members through building character within ourselves

Simon Sports:Students come together for weekly soccer, basketball, and cricket practices on campus, and University intramural leagues. Simon also participates in external business school soccer and basketball tournaments annually.

### International Student ratio:

這點其實要學校的國際生比例夠低才能寫，大概就是說可以逃離舒適圈，深入了解美國當地文化之類的，如此一來可以展現自己勇於接受挑戰的個性

### Core Value:

每個學校的商學院想培育出什麼樣的學生都不太一定，有些學校會把商學院的Core Value寫得很明確，比方說Purdue是Integrity & Team Work, OSU是Leadership, Case Western 是 Critical Thinking，若學校的Core Value跟自己Essay的故事能夠勾起來的話，申請人可以在末段再次強調自己有多適合這間學校

Simon graduates excel at information gathering and analysis and are prepared to use those skills to drive growth.

leadership

A finance degree is a passport to a variety of career opportunities.

we value well-developed communication skills in our applicants. We seek self-motivated individuals who believe that graduate study will significantly enhance both their technical and personal skill sets. Additionally, we seek evidence of team experiences and leadership skills, shown through extracurricular experience and/or on-the-job projects.

we consider work experience to include both internships and/or post-baccalaureate experience. The quality and quantity of experience, combined with career goals, are equally evaluated. Your decision to pursue graduate study should be consistent with the career goals typically offered for a business master’s program.

We seek candidates committed to academic excellence. We review GMAT or GRE exam scores and consider the overall results, as well as your quantitative and verbal distribution on the exam. Additionally, we evaluate all undergraduate and graduate coursework that has been completed prior to applying. Specific review of business, accounting, and math grades are considered in addition to your cumulative GPA. Applicant concerns on any dimension of the academic profile should be briefly addressed in the required essay.

Simon’s MS programs in Accountancy, Business Analytics, Finance, and Marketing Analytics are designed to help you achieve a new level of clarity in your career, and fully develop your potential as a leader.

Business can be a powerful force for the common good. At Simon, we'll show you how to use your business skills to make an impact beyond the bottom line. Our service-based clubs and volunteer opportunities, in conjunction with our community partnerships, help you reflect on the kind of leader you want to be, influencing your outlook on the world not just for a semester, but for a lifetime.

### Alumni Network:

這點其實真的沒東西寫再說，因為每個學校都會說自己的Alumni圈子有多大，其實已經算不上學校的個別特色了，如果真的要寫的話，建議要真的有認識校友並詢問能否將其寫到Essay中，若真的有認識再寫的話也比較相對有說服力

### Career Service:

這點我覺得也是沒東西寫再說，大部分的學校都有Career Coach或是履歷面試的服務，所以其實也算不上甚麼個別特色了
