The financial industry is ever-changing and the development of new technologies is reshaping our society. However, no matter how time evolves, finance will always be a crucial foundation for visionary entrepreneurs or enthusiastic dreamers to attain their passions. Accordingly, my goal of pursuing a master’s degree in finance at Arizona State University’s W.P. Carey School of Business is to ultimately help individuals and corporations make better financial decisions—scaling up their assets and meeting their financial targets. I will be working for enabling my clients to achieve their life goals. For my long-term plans, I aspire to become a financial advisor after I graduate, accumulating experience before entering a larger enterprise.

To better navigate the evolving financial industry, I will keep an open mind and focus on acquiring the knowledge and skills that will lead me to fulfill my ambition. With the courses ***Quantitative Methods in Finance*** and ***Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Applications in Finance*** provided by W.P. Carey, I hope to familiarize myself with quantitative models for better financial decision-making; the real-world case studies in your courses will teach me how to make decisions more efficiently with analysis models. Moreover, I intend to take advantage of W.P. Carey’s vibrant student organizations, such as Conscious Capitalism and GPO Consulting Club, to expand connections and explore different possibilities in my financial career. With the graduate education at W.P. Carey, I will have gained excellent quantitative skills, sufficient knowledge of wealth management and financial modeling, and analytical thinking for making better financial decisions. The school’s wide variety of resources will lay the foundation for me to add value to an equally wide variety of societal aspects.

Apart from staying competitive, I firmly believe that participating in volunteer activities and broadening my horizons are among the best ways to be part of the changes we hope to see. During my undergraduate studies, I had an opportunity to travel to Nepal as a leader of an international medical volunteer group. To alleviate local poverty issues, my partner and I created a connection between the local community committees and a non-profit organization in Taiwan to ensure their income from selling handicrafts to Taiwan. My volunteer work in Nepal not only cultivated my empathy toward a wide variety of people but also motivated me to create a positive impact in the world. I hope to share my volunteer experiences within your diverse environment, and to be remembered for making a valuable contribution to Tempe’s vibrant community.

I value the qualities of altruism, generosity, and kindness. My goal as a financial advisor is not only to help my clients make better financial decisions but also to educate them on the correct financial concepts. I am a team player with experience in building connections between different cultures to propel my partners to greater achievements. I believe that I am fully prepared to meet the requirements of your program, and I am immensely excited to become part of W.P. Carey’s enriching community.

The very first question that flashed through my mind the day I stepped onto the campus as a first-year student was “what can I take with me except knowledge from books and a piece of diploma after four years of undergraduate studies?” I wanted to utilize every moment to create more valuable times. Therefore, I participated in several extracurricular activities, such as campus recruiting events, an international volunteer group, and an alumni association, to explore more possibilities in my life. These experiences also prepared me to become a more well-rounded decision-maker.

During the period I served as the CEO of NCU Campus Recruiting Events, my job was to organize several career fairs and corporate briefings for the school. Among the events we had held, the spring career fair was our major event of the year. We had 25 team members, with 8 months of planning leading up to the event. We prepared documents and delivered presentations to raise funds from the government, checked every tiny detail with 129 attending corporates, and held several marketing campaigns to attract students to participate in our events.

However, because of the pandemic outbreak, we were forced to cancel our physical career fair a month before the scheduled date. Although the news was demoralizing, I regarded the obstruction as an invaluable opportunity for our team to create something fresh and innovative. After a three-day discussion, we decided to collaborate with Tempest Digital Ltd., a gaming company founded by NCU alumni, to host the career fair in the form of an online game. We wanted to build a new form of career fair while at the same time containing the core features of physical events. We designed customized cabins for each firm in the game so that the participants can visit different firms on the map and explore recruiting information provided by the firm. More importantly, the participants could not only experience the joy in gaming but also deliver their resume instantly or consult with HRs through webcam directly. Consequently, visitors at the career fair almost doubled the achieved numbers from the previous years, and the number of views had reached 30K within three days. We also achieved an 88% overall satisfaction rate of attending corporates.

The pandemic put many events on hold, but it could never stop anyone from pursuing their goals. The world is constantly changing and so are our plans. I am grateful that these experiences strengthened my will to face the unknown, motivated me to always keep up with the trends of the world, and reminded me to relentlessly improve myself. I am convinced that accumulating knowledge and polishing my skill sets in every aspect are the best ways to adapt to different scenarios and changes. To become a specialist in the field of finance, I see W.P. Carey School of Business as my best investing opportunity, and I sincerely believe that together we can make meaningful changes and make the world a better place.
