Rutgers Business School

The financial industry is ever-changing and the development of new technologies is reshaping our society. However, no matter how time evolves, finance will always be a crucial foundation for visionary entrepreneurs or enthusiastic dreamers to attain their passions. My goal to pursue a master’s degree in quantitative finance at Rutgers Business School is to ultimately help individuals and corporations make better financial decisions thus enabling them to achieve their life goals. To further my long-term ambition, I aspire to become a financial advisor after I graduate, accumulating experience before entering a larger enterprise. 

I believe that excellent quantitative skills, sufficient knowledge of wealth management and financial modeling, and analytical thinking are timelessly essential tools for making better financial decisions. To gain more practical experience in asset management, I launched and ran a six-figure fund for my family in 2020. My background in finance had equipped me with the fundamental knowledge of financial concepts and theories, and I learned how to conduct proper fundamental analysis and evaluate a company using several financial models, such as the discounted cash flow model from the *Financial Statement Analysis* course. Additionally, to improve my trading strategies, I took the *Financial Engineering* course, wherein I learned to utilize Python programming to adjust my trading strategies based on backtesting results. These early successes made me eager to learn and become a more well-rounded financial advisor. 

Apart from staying competitive, I firmly believe that participating in volunteer activities and broadening my horizons are among the best ways to be part of the changes we hope to see. During my undergraduate studies, I had an opportunity to travel to Nepal as a leader of an international medical volunteer group. In addition to medical services, one of our primary goals was to tackle the problems arising from poverty. To aid local people dealing with poverty issues, my partner and I devised a viable method for them to generate steady income. In cooperation with local university students, we created a connection between a local community committee in Jugedi, Nepal, and the Taipei Global Charity Association, a non-profit organization in Taiwan, to ensure that they could earn money from selling their handicrafts to Taiwan. Living among the Nepalis, experiencing their daily lives, and witnessing their extreme poverty, I learned that financial accessibility is a vital stepping stone to education and health. My volunteer work in Nepal not only cultivated my empathy toward a wide variety of people but also motivated me to create a positive impact in the world. I believe the Rutgers Business School is the perfect environment for me to expand my academic and practical experience, explore in-depth training, and gain hands-on tools to further my goals.

To better navigate the evolving financial industry, I will keep my mind open and persistently focus on acquiring the knowledge and skills that will lead me to fulfill my ambition. My short-term study plan is therefore to take the best advantage of my graduate education. With the course Data Mining and **Quantitative Equity Trading Strategies**, I hope to familiarize myself with quantitative models for better financial decision-making. The real-world case studies in your courses will teach me how to make decisions more efficiently with analysis models. Moreover, the Applied Portfolio Management Course, which focuses on practical aspects, will help me to better comprehend the larger picture of portfolio management and learn how to tackle potential risks. I also intend to take advantage of the career management resources offered by Rutgers Business School, as the school provides abundant experiential learning opportunities for me to polish my problem-solving skills and put theories into practice. The school’s wide variety of resources will help me tailor my skill set to meet the market’s need, allow me to expand my connections and explore different possibilities in my financial career, and lay the foundation for me to add value to an equally wide variety of societal aspects.

I value the qualities of altruism, generosity, and kindness. My goal as a financial advisor is not only to help my clients make better financial decisions but to educate them on the correct financial concepts. I am a team player with experience in building connections between different cultures to propel my partners to greater achievements. I believe that I am fully prepared to meet the requirements of your program, and I am immensely excited to become one of the members of Rutgers’ enriching community.
