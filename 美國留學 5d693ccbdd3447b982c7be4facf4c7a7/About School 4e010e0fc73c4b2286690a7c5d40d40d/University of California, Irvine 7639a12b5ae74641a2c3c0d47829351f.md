## Essay 1

I believe that healthy financial decisions are crucial to a brighter future. Accordingly, my goal of pursuing a master’s degree in finance at Paul Merage School of Business is to ultimately help individuals and corporations make better financial decisions, enabling them to achieve their life goals. To achieve my long-term goals, I aspire to become a financial advisor, accumulating experience before entering a larger enterprise. My background in finance had equipped me with the fundamental knowledge of financial theories, and I’ve learned to conduct proper fundamental analysis and evaluate a company using several financial models. Additionally, I took the *Financial Engineering* course, wherein I learned to utilize Python programming to adjust my trading strategies based on backtesting results.

Apart from staying competitive, I firmly believe that participating in volunteer activities and broadening my horizons are among the best ways to be part of the changes we hope to see. During my undergraduate studies, I had an opportunity to travel to Nepal as a leader of an international medical volunteer group. To alleviate local poverty issues, my partner and I created a connection between the local community committees and a non-profit organization in Taiwan to ensure their income from selling handicrafts to Taiwan. My volunteer work in Nepal not only cultivated my empathy toward a wide variety of people but also motivated me to create a positive impact in the world. The experience inspires me to learn and become a more well-rounded financial advisor. I believe Merage School is the perfect environment for me to accumulate my academic and practical experience, receive in-depth training, and cultivate professional skills to reach my goals.

To navigate the evolving financial industry, I will keep an open mind and focus on acquiring the knowledge and skills that will lead me to fulfill my ambition. I intend to take advantage of Merage’s Centers of Excellence for its dedication to helping students expand their connections and explore different possibilities in their financial careers. The internship experience offered by the Center for Investment and Wealth Management is extremely appealing, and I hope to further my professional skill set and make contributions to Orange County Community through this program. Moreover, the Capstone Project, which focuses on practical aspects, allows students to tackle unstructured, real-life business issues with partner companies. I will utilize this precious opportunity to polish my problem-solving capabilities and put theories into practice. Merage’s wide variety of resources will lay the foundation for me to add value to an equally wide variety of societal aspects.

I value the qualities of altruism, generosity, and kindness. My goal as a financial advisor is not only to help my clients make better financial decisions but also to educate them on the correct financial concepts. I am a team player with experience in building connections between different cultures to propel my partners to greater achievements. I believe that I am fully prepared to meet the requirements of your program, and I am immensely excited to become part of Merage’s enriching community.

## Essay 2

When I was the CEO of NCU Campus Recruiting Events, my job was to organize several career fairs and corporate briefings for the school. Among the events we had held, the spring career fair was our major event of the year. We had 25 team members, with 8 months of planning leading up to the event.

However, because of the pandemic outbreak, we were forced to cancel our physical career fair a month before the scheduled date. Although the news was demoralizing, I regarded the obstruction as an invaluable opportunity for our team to create something fresh and innovative. After a three-day discussion, we decided to collaborate with Tempest Digital Ltd., a gaming company, to host the career fair in the form of an online game. Surprisingly, visitors at the career fair almost doubled the achieved numbers from the previous years, and the number of views had reached 30K within three days.

I am grateful that the experiences strengthened my will to face the unknown, motivated me to always keep up with the trends of the world, and reminded me to relentlessly improve myself. I am convinced that accumulating knowledge and polishing my skill sets in every aspect are the best ways to adapt to different scenarios and changes. To become a specialist in the field of finance, I see Paul Merage School of Business as my best investing opportunity, and I sincerely believe that together we can make meaningful changes and make the world a better place.
