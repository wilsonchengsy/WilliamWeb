But a business education today—one that prepares students for immediate relevance and lasting impact—goes deeper. It places these fundamentals into a new and broader context. It’s about cultural awareness. Challenges to traditional thinking. And a mindset that balances ambition and ethics.

At Fisher College of Business, we believe business leadership requires a distinct and nuanced set of skills for a business world that’s changing at a pace never before seen. Innovation and entrepreneurial leadership create new markets and disruption virtually overnight. A strong global perspective challenges familiar traditions and forges untold partnerships. All of these test the balance of risk and reward, and the principles necessary to navigate new ideas and opportunities.

These central themes—innovation and entrepreneurial spirit, global awareness and principled leadership—are essential to what distinguishes Fisher graduates when they enter the work force. These themes provide a consistent backdrop for our curriculum and programs; they guide our thought leaders; and they directly reflect the values of our college’s namesake. These ideas are essential for a singularly engaging and impactful experience on our campus, and for success beyond it.

**Your ideas. Your traditions. Your experiences. Your curiosity.**

Everything our students bring to the classroom enriches our conversations, broadens our understanding and prepares us to thrive in a diverse and dynamic business world.

"Education for Citizenship”

I believe that healthy financial decisions are crucial to a brighter future. I was born in a small village where agriculture dominates the economy, and people and small businesses have a relatively low level of financial literacy. Growing up in such an environment instilled in me a desire to help my community increase their access to the financial system and maximize the value of their assets. Accordingly, my goal in pursuing a specialized master’s degree in finance at the Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business is to help individuals and corporations make better financial decisions, allowing them to achieve their long-term life goals.

During my studies at National Central University, I had an opportunity to travel to Nepal as a member of an international medical volunteer group. The experience cultivated my empathy toward a wide variety of people, and I became more cognizant of the importance of caring for those in need. In addition to medical services, one of our primary goals was to assist with problems arising from poverty. Nepal is ranked 180th to 190th globally in GDP per capita. Many Nepalis don’t have a bank account. Instead, they accrue wealth through physical assets such as livestock and properties. To aid local people dealing with poverty-related issues, my partner and I devised a viable method for them to generate steady income. In cooperation with local university students, we created a connection between a local community committee in Jugedi, Nepal, and the Taipei Global Charity Association, a non-profit organization in Taiwan, to ensure that they could earn money from selling their handicrafts to Taiwan. Living among the Nepalis, experiencing their daily lives, and witnessing their extreme poverty, I learned that financial accessibility is a vital stepping stone to education and health. My volunteer work in Nepal not only broadened my horizons but also motivated me to become a financial advisor.

To gain more practical experience in asset management, I launched and ran a six-figure fund for my family in 2020. My background in finance had equipped me with the fundamental knowledge of financial concepts and theories, and I learned how to conduct proper fundamental analysis and evaluate a company using several financial models, such as the discounted cash flow model from the *Financial Statement Analysis* course. Additionally, to improve my trading strategies, I took the *Financial Engineering* course, wherein I learned to utilize Python programming to adjust my trading strategies based on backtesting results. These early successes made me eager to learn and become a more well-rounded financial advisor. I believe Fisher College of Business is the perfect environment for me to expand my academic and practical experience, explore in-depth training, and gain hands-on tools to further my goals.

I believe that proficient quantitative skills, sufficient knowledge of wealth management and financial modeling, and analytical thinking are vital tools for a financial advisor. My short-term study plan is therefore to take the best advantage of your Investment Management track. With the *Quantitative Investment with Python* course, I hope to familiarize myself with quantitative models for better financial decision-making. The real-world case studies in this course will teach me how to make decisions more efficiently with analysis models. Moreover, the Finance Consulting Practicum, which focuses on practical aspects, allows students to tackle unstructured business issues with the knowledge gained from SMF courses. The co-curricular activities offered by Fisher College of Business are also extremely appealing. I intend to take advantage of Fisher’s *Student Investment Manage* course, as the course provides practical portfolio management opportunities. Participating in case competitions will help me polish my problem-solving skills and put theories into practice. I also hope to join the CFA Society of Columbus and Fisher’s vibrant student clubs, such as SMF Council and the Fisher Graduate Finance Association, to expand my connections and explore different possibilities in my financial career. The school’s wide variety of resources will lay the foundation for me to add value to an equally wide variety of societal aspects.

I value the qualities of altruism, generosity, and kindness. My goal as a financial advisor is not only to help my clients make better financial decisions, but to educate them on the correct financial concepts. I am a team player with experience in building connections between different cultures to propel my partners to greater achievements. I believe that I am fully prepared to meet the requirements of your program, and I am immensely excited to become one of the members of Fisher’s enriching community.

When I was the CEO of NCU Campus Recruiting Events, my job was to organize several career fairs and corporate briefings for the school. Among the events we had held, the spring career fair was our major event of the year. We had 25 team members, with 8 months of planning leading up to the event.

However, because of the pandemic outbreak, we were forced to cancel our physical career fair a month before the scheduled date. Although the news was demoralizing, I regarded the obstruction as an invaluable opportunity for our team to create something fresh and innovative. After a three-day discussion, we decided to collaborate with Tempest Digital Ltd., a gaming company, to host the career fair in the form of an online game. Surprisingly, visitors at the career fair almost doubled the achieved numbers from the previous years, and the number of views had reached 30K within three days.

I am grateful that the experiences strengthened my will to face the unknown, motivated me to always keep up with the trends of the world, and reminded me to relentlessly improve myself. I am convinced that accumulating knowledge and polishing my skill sets in every aspect are the best ways to adapt to different scenarios and changes. To become a specialist in the field of finance, I see Fisher College of Business as my best investing opportunity, and I sincerely believe that together we can make meaningful changes and make the world a better place.
