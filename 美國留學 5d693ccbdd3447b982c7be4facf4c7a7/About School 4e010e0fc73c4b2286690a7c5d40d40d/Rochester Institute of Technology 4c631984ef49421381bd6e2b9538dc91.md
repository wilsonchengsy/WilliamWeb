I believe that healthy financial decisions are crucial to a brighter future. I was born in a small village where agriculture dominates the local economy, and people and small businesses have a relatively low level of financial literacy. Growing up in such an environment instilled in me a desire to help my community increase their access to the financial system and maximize the value of their assets. Accordingly, my goal in pursuing a master’s degree in finance at the Rochester Institute of Technology’s Saunders College of Business is to help individuals and corporations make better financial decisions, enabling them to achieve their long-term life goals.

During my studies at National Central University, I had an opportunity to travel to Nepal as a member of an international medical volunteer group. The experience cultivated my empathy toward a wide variety of people, and I became more cognizant of the importance of caring for those in need. In addition to medical services, one of our primary goals was to assist with problems arising from poverty. Nepal is ranked 180th to 190th globally in GDP per capita. Many Nepalis don’t have a bank account. Instead, they accrue wealth through physical assets such as livestock and properties. To aid local people dealing with poverty-related issues, my partner and I devised a viable method for them to generate steady income. In cooperation with local university students, we created a connection between a local community committee in Jugedi, Nepal, and the Taipei Global Charity Association, a non-profit organization in Taiwan, to ensure that they could earn money from selling their handicrafts to Taiwan. Living among the Nepalis, experiencing their daily lives, and witnessing their extreme poverty, I learned that financial accessibility is a vital stepping stone to education and health. My volunteer work in Nepal not only broadened my horizons but also motivated me to become a financial advisor.

To gain more practical experience in asset management, I launched and ran a six-figure fund for my family in 2020. My background in finance had equipped me with the fundamental knowledge of financial concepts and theories, and I learned how to conduct proper fundamental analysis and evaluate a company using several financial models, such as the discounted cash flow model from the *Financial Statement Analysis* course. Additionally, to improve my trading strategies, I took the *Financial Engineering* course, wherein I learned to utilize Python programming to adjust my trading strategies based on backtesting results. These early successes made me eager to learn and become a more well-rounded financial advisor. I believe Saunders College of Business is the perfect environment for me to expand my academic and practical experience, explore in-depth training, and gain hands-on tools to further my goals.

I believe that proficient quantitative skills, sufficient knowledge of wealth management and financial modeling, and analytical thinking are vital tools for a financial advisor. My short-term study plan is therefore to take the best advantage of your Investment Management track. My short-term study plan is therefore to take the best advantage of my graduate education. With the course *Stock Market Algorithmic Trading* and *Data Management for Business Analytics*, I hope to familiarize myself with quantitative models for better financial decision-making. The real-world case studies in your courses will teach me how to make decisions more efficiently with analysis models. Moreover, the Portfolio Management Course, which focuses on practical aspects, will help me to better comprehend the larger picture of portfolio management and learn how to tackle potential risks. I also intend to take advantage of the experiential learning resources offered by Saunders College of Business, such as capstone courses and case competitions, to polish my problem-solving skills and put theories into practice. Career services and cooperative education opportunities provided by your school are extremely appealing as well. The school’s wide variety of resources will help me tailor my skill set to meet the market’s need, allow me to expand my connections and explore different possibilities in my financial career, and lay the foundation for me to add value to an equally wide variety of societal aspects.

I value the qualities of altruism, generosity, and kindness. My goal as a financial advisor is not only to help my clients make better financial decisions, but to educate them on the correct financial concepts. I am a team player with experience in building connections between different cultures to propel my partners to greater achievements. I believe that I am fully prepared to meet the requirements of your program, and I am immensely excited to become one of the members of Saunders’ enriching community.
