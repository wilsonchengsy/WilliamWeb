### Motivation

I believe that healthy financial decision making is a crucial key that could open a dreamer's door and make a brighter future happen. I was born in a small village where agriculture is prevailing, and people and small businesses there have relatively low level of financial literacy. Growing up in such environment, I've always hoped to help the entire society increase their access to finance system and maximize the utility of their assets. My goal to pursue a Master of Finance degree in Simons Business School, University of Rochester is to ultimately help individuals and corporates make better financial decisions, and hence possess the capability to achieve their long-term life goals.

### Why you (Nepal, personality)

During my study at the National Central University, I had an opportunity to travel to Nepal as a member of an international medical volunteer group. Assisting the poor and sick had cultivated my empathy towards a wider view of the world, and I became more observant and caring with people in need of help. Apart from medical services, one of our main goals is to find a solution for overall poverty there. Nepal is a country ranked 180+ among all the countries when it comes to GDP per capita. Many people who live in the country don't even have a bank account. Instead, they have to save their values using physical assets, such as livestocks and properties. To assist local people dealing with poverty issues, my partner and I came up with a viable method for them to generate steady income. Cooperated with local university students, we built a connection between local mother committee and a non-profit organization in Taiwan to ensure that they can earn money from selling handicrafts to Taiwan. From living their daily lives in Nepal and witnessing the extreme poverty there, I recognized that financial accessibility is a stepping stone to education and health. The trip to Nepal had broadened my horizons and motivated me to become a financial advisor one day.

I want to prepare my self with skills of asset management and financial modeling

### Gap (why you need the degree)

To learn more about asset management in practice, I started running a six-figure fund for my family in 2020. My background of finance from being a finance major in college years had equipped me with the fundamental knowledge to finance-related concepts and theories. I learned how to properly conduct fundamental analysis and how to evaluate a company using several financial models such as discounted cash flow model from the course "Financial Statement Analysis" I took in school.  Additionally, In order to polish my trading strategies, I took the course "Financial Engineering", in which I had gained knowledge of applying Python programming to adjust my trading strategies according to backtesting results. To further broadening my academic and practical experiences, I deeply believe that I need more in-depth training and hands-on experiences to become a well-rounded financial advisor, and the Simon Business School would be the perfect environment for me to delve into the more advanced study.

### why school

I believe that strong communication skills, sufficient knowledge of wealth management and financial modeling, and a sense of analytical thinking are very important in order to be working in the financial advisory industry. By taking the course "Quantitative Finance with Python", I would become familiar with using quantitative models for better financial decision making. Besides that, because of the experience of real-world cases studies in this course, I believe that it can efficiently help me learn how to properly apply the models on decision making. Moreover, in the course "Asset Management", since the course focuses on practical aspects, it would provide a chance for me to see a bigger picture of portfolio management and to learn how to tackle potential risks. Furthermore, not to mention that the opportunity of a real-world experience in Simon would be abundant. The program with internship tracks in the United States provided by the Simon Business school is very appealing as well. From all the above reasons, I consider the Simon Business School program an indispensable chance for me to strengthen my ability to work in the financial field anywhere in the States and beyond. I will also take advantages of Simon Business School's professional student clubs, such as Simon VISION consulting and Meliora Fund, to polish my problem-solving skills and to put the theories into practice. A wide variety of visions and massive resources that are provided by Simon would lay the foundation for me to add values to different aspects of the entire society.

### short-term long-term goal & conclusion

For my short-term goal, I hope to be a financial advisor of a financial institution, helping my individual clients to meet their financial goals and helping my corporate client to expend their scales. I also hope to get the CFA Level II license 3~5 years after I graduate from your school. As for my long-term goal, I aim to be either a senior financial advisor or a financial manager. I am a person who appreciate the value of selflessness, generosity, and kindness. Therefore, my goal as a financial advisor is not only helping my clients to make better financial decisions but educating them with correct financial concepts. I am confidence that I am a great team-worker who can build connections among different cultural backgrounds and grow better together with my friends. I believe that I am fully-prepared to meet the requirements of your program, and I am profoundly excited to become one of the members of Simon's community if given the chance, and become ever better.

### long term goal.

### Bill Gates Foundation

To expand access to digital financial services so the poorest people around the globe can build security and prosperity for themselves, their families, and their communities.

In just the past six years, 1.2 billion people worldwide have gained access to bank and mobile money accounts.1 This revolution in financial inclusion has the potential to offer a pathway out of poverty for hundreds of millions of people and to spur broad economic growth. expand the availability of affordable and reliable financial services that serve the needs of all,

millions of people remain trapped in a cycle of poverty that is difficult to escape, financial exclusion is a significant driver of this cycle.

> Most poor households still operate almost entirely through a cash economy. This means they have to save using physical assets, such as livestock or jewelry. Cash gets spent, animals die, and jewelry can be lost or stolen. What’s more, these forms of savings earn no interest and can actually lose value over time.
